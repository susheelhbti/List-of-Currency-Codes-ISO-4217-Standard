List of Currency Codes (ISO 4217 Standard)


When working with the Internationalization API of JavaScript and you work with currencies, you will need the accurate list of currency codes, the one maintained by International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The purpose of this standard is to establish globally recognized codes for currencies. These codes can be represented either as a 3-digit alphabetic code or a 3-digit numeric code. In addition to traditional currency codes, this standard also includes codes for items that are "similar" to currencies such as precious metals like gold (XAU), silver (XAG), palladium (XPD) and platinum (XPT).
